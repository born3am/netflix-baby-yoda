Lin-Manuel Miranda-directed musical drama film tick, tick…BOOM! is here to serve up everything you want and more. The film is based on John Larson's 1990 stage musical production of the same name, and similarly follows an aspiring theatre composer (Andrew Garfield) who endures a quarter-life crisis as he approaches 30 and does not feel any closer to achieving his dream. Not only is there the amazing singing and dancing you'd expect from any Miranda-led project, but there is also a stunningly talented cast that includes Garfield, Alexandra Shipp, Judith Light, Vanessa Hudgens, Joshua Henry, Bradley Whitford, and Richard Kind, all poised to take you on a memorable musical moviegoing experience.
